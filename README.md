## About the Project

This is my personal portfolio website, designed to serve as a central hub for showcasing my work, skills, and professional journey. The primary goal is to provide a clean, responsive, and intuitive user experience for visitors interested in my profile.

The website is built with a focus on modern web development practices, leveraging the power of client-side technologies to deliver a fast and engaging experience.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop monitors.
* **Clean and Modern UI:** A sleek and contemporary design to highlight content effectively.
* **Project Showcase:** Dedicated sections to display past projects with descriptions and links.
* **Skills Section:** Clearly outlines my technical proficiencies.
* **Contact Form/Information:** Easy ways for visitors to get in touch.
* **Smooth Navigation:** Intuitive and user-friendly navigation.
* **Fast Loading:** Built for performance.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using a combination of fundamental and modern frontend technologies:

* **HTML5:** For structuring the content of the website.
* **CSS3:** For styling and visual presentation.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive elements and dynamic content.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs without leaving your HTML. It significantly streamlines the styling process and ensures consistency.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (if you plan to compile Tailwind CSS locally, otherwise not strictly required for just viewing the HTML/CSS/JS)
* npm or yarn (package manager, comes with Node.js)
* A web browser

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/frontendguyvth/portfolio-js.git](https://github.com/frontendguyvth/portfolio-js.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd portfolio-js
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies (if you plan to work with Tailwind CSS for development):**
    If you've used a `package.json` for Tailwind setup, run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
    *Note: If Tailwind CSS is compiled into a static CSS file (e.g., `dist/output.css`) and you're just viewing, `npm install` might not be strictly necessary for basic usage.*

4.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the website.
    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    open index.html
    # On Windows
    start index.html
    ```
    For development, you might want to use a live server extension in your VS Code (like "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey).
